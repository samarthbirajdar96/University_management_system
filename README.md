#University Event Management System## Frameworks and Language Used* Java* Spring Boot* Jakarta Persistence* Lombok* Hibernate Validator * H2 Database##Data Flow### Controller (ApiController)* Handles HTTP requests and manages the flow of data between the client and the services.* Defines RESTful endpoints for managing students and events.* Utilizes Spring's @RestController to create RESTful API endpoints.* Validates input data using Hibernate Validator annotations.### Services (StudentService and EventService)* Contains business logic and serves as an intermediary between the controller and the repository.* Provides methods for adding, retrieving, updating, and removing students and events.* Utilizes data validation and transformation.###Repository (RepoStudent and RepoEvent)* Interfaces that extend Spring Data JPA's CrudRepository.* Responsible for interacting with the database and performing CRUD operations on student and event entities.* Utilizes Spring Data JPA to generate SQL queries based on method names.### Database Design* The project uses an H2 in-memory database, which is defined in the application.properties file.* There are two entities: Student and Event, which are defined as JPA entities with corresponding database tables.* The Student entity has relationships with the Department enum. * The Event entity stores information about university events.###Data Structures Used* Classes and Enums:* Student: Represents student data, including their ID, name, age, and department.* Event: Represents university events, including their ID, name, location, date, and time.*  Department (Enum): Enumerates various academic departments* Collections:     *  Lists and Sets: Used to store and manipulate collections of students and events.* Validation:       * Hibernate Validator annotations (@Pattern, @Min, @Max) to validate data.###Project SummaryThe University Event Management System is a Spring Boot-based application that manages student and event data. It provides a RESTful API for performing CRUD operations on students and events. Students are validated for name format and age range, while events store details such as name, location, date, and time. The application uses an H2 in-memory database for data storage and retrieval.The key features of the project include:* Adding, retrieving, updating, and removing students and events.* Validating student data for name format and age range.* Utilizing Spring Data JPA for database operations.* Implementing a RESTful API using Spring Boot.* This project serves as a basic template for managing university-related events and student information. Additional features and enhancements can be built upon this foundation.
